# Scripted Sisterhood: Analyzing Bechdel Test Triumphs
*Pandamonium: Tiago Freitas, Deniz Kasap, Riza Arseven, Eren Saydar and Matthijs Scheerder


## Abstract












In "Femme Frames," we scrutinize the portrayal of women in film through the Bechdel Test—requiring at least two women to converse about something other than a man. Our data-driven exploration investigates patterns and disparities in gender representation, sparking a conversation about storytelling's societal impact. Recent films like Oppenheimer and Avatar 2, failing the Bechdel Test, underscore its continued relevance. This project aims to unveil insights into cinematic narratives and promote positive change within the industry. Join us on a journey where every frame counts and every story told contributes to a more inclusive cinematic landscape.



## Research Questions

* Research Question 1: Are there hidden relationships for the prediction of the Bechdel test?
* Research Question 2: Can we introduce another metric of representation of women in cinema, like the female cast ratio?
